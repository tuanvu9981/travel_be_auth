#     - echo "Compile complete."

# unit-test-job:   # This job runs in the test stage.
#   stage: test    # It only starts when the job in the build stage completes successfully.
#   script:
#     - echo "Running unit tests... This will take about 60 seconds."
#     - sleep 60
#     - echo "Code coverage is 90%"

# lint-test-job:   # This job also runs in the test stage.
#   stage: test    # It can run at the same time as unit-test-job (in parallel).
#   script:
#     - echo "Linting code... This will take about 10 seconds."
#     - sleep 10
#     - echo "No lint issues found."
